# PirateGameAI

Project Reflections
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was provided with a baseline code that gave an initial structure for the pirate intelligent agent. This included foundational elements such as initialization and a few basic functions. From there, I enhanced and expanded upon this code to integrate reinforcement learning algorithms and neural network components. This allowed the agent to learn from its environment and make informed decisions. The sections of code that I developed from scratch included the neural network training, state management, and the reward system.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve problems and study the performance of computer hardware and software. Their work often intersects with various disciplines, driving advancements in fields like medicine, economics, engineering, and more. The work of computer scientists is foundational to modern society, as it powers the technologies we rely on daily, from smartphones to large scale data centers.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, when presented with a problem, I begin by analyzing it thoroughly to understand its complexities and requirements. This involves breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable components. From there, I consider the available algorithms or methodologies that can be applied, often opting to design a new algorithm if necessary. Iterative testing and optimization are essential parts of the process, ensuring efficiency and correctness in the solution.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My primary ethical responsibility to both the end user and the organization is to ensure the security and privacy of data. This involves implementing robust security measures and being transparent about data usage. Additionally, I'm obligated to produce reliable and efficient software, avoiding shortcuts that could lead to vulnerabilities or malfunctions. Upholding the integrity of my work and being honest about its capabilities and limitations is paramount. Lastly, considering the broader societal impacts of the technologies I develop is crucial, ensuring they are used for the betterment of society and not to its detriment.
